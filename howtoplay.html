                <h1>How to play Pain<span class="text-muted">t</span>ful</h1>
                <p>Pain(t)ful is a simple multiplayer drawing game and most parts of it
                should be self explanatory.</p>
                <h2>1. Enter a game</h2>
                <p>You can either start a new game or join an existing one.<br>
                In order to start a new game, press the 'New Game' button and enter
                your name.<br>
                If someone else already created a game, join their game by entering
                the game ID (anyone that already joined a game can tell you the ID)
                and clicking on the 'Join Game' button.</p>
                <h2>2. Start the game</h2>
                <p>As soon as at least three people joined a game, anyone of them can
                start it by clicking on the 'Start Game' button.<br>
                Now, every player receives an individual quest, i.e. some term consisting
                of two words which they need to draw. As soon as everyone uploaded their
                paintings the actual game can start.</p>
                <h2>3. Guess</h2>
                <p>The first player's painting is now presented to all other players
                (while the first player needs to wait). They have to guess what this
                painting shows and enter the term consisting of two words and submit
                their guess by clicking on the 'Submit' button.</p>
                <h2>4. Choose answer</h2>
                <p>After every player has submitted their guess, all those guesses
                together with the correct answer are presented to the players. They
                must decide for one answer by clicking on the respective button.</p>
                <h2>5. End of round</h2>
                <p>If every player has made their choice, the score of the first round
                is presented. The score is calculated as follows:
                <ul class="list-unstyled">
                    <li>If a player guessed what the artist has drawn, the player and
                    the artist gain 5 points</li>
                    <li>If a player chose the correct answer, the player and the artist
                    gain 2 points</li>
                    <li>If a player chose the wrong answer, the player that submitted the
                    (wrong) guess gains 1 point</li>
                </ul>
                </p>
                <h2>6. End of game</h2>
                <p>Steps 3-5 are now repeated until every painting has been discussed.<br>
                Winner is the player with the highest score.</p>
